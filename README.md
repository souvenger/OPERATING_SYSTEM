# OPERATING_SYSTEM
An Operating System (OS) is an interface between a computer user and computer hardware. An operating system is a software which performs all the basic tasks like file management, memory management, process management, handling input and output, and controlling external devices such as disk drives and printers.
This course teaches about the operating system abstractions, mechanisms, and their implementations in xv6.
